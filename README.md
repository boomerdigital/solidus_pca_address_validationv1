```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```


Feature Road Map
-----------------

## Round One
- [ ] Set up test account for local development
- [ ] Get [address autocomplete bound fields](http://www.pcapredict.com/en-gb/address-validation/try-it-now/) working on address checkout page
  - Get JS sample code from PCA
  - Click on autocomplete address and autofill the rest of the form
  - Click on any address field to trigger autocomplete dropdown
  - Autocomplete will work in a suggestive manner, user will still be able to enter address manually in checkout

## Round Two
- [ ] In case address does not come up in autocomplete, create a way to warn the client of the failed validation
- [ ] Add validation button in the admin order panel so an admin can validate an address manually


Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_pca_address_validation/factories'
```
